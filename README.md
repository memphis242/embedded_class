### Summary
This repo is meant to hold the assignments I've done for ECE376 - Embedded Systems here at NDSU. We used a PIC18F4620 as our microcontroller. The professor of this course, Dr. Jacob Glower, did give us a neat evaluation board with the PICs containing a bootloader that allowed us to program the uC over serial. However, I personally preferred the approach I had been using before - PIC18F4620 on a breadboard + MPLAB X + XC8. The class went with Eval Board + MPLAB 8 + HITECH. In any case, the point was to accomplish the tasks the assignments had asked for, and to this end, I present my code in this repo. Each folder contains the MPLAB X project along with a README.md file describing that particular assignment.
